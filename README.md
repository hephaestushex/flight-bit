# flight-bit
micro:bit based rc flight companion, connects to your laptop and gives some data on heading, pitch and roll movements.
Unfortunately, due to the microbit's lack of a gyroscope, accurate measurements cannot be guaranteed in fast moving planes. It would be more prudent to use this as a demo,
a sort of quick fix. Slow moving aircraft that do not pull high gs would get the best usage.
